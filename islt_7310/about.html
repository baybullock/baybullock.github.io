		<p><strong>Baylee Bullock</strong>-A compliment from a 1st grade teacher on my first day as a transfer student is what put me on the path to <em>loving art</em> and becoming an art educator. For years I found love and enthusiasm in the subject and participated in multiple art shows from 4th-12th grade and won the occasional award. After highschool, I spent the next five years earning an Associate of Arts Degree with Mineral Area College, and a Bachelorâ€™s Degree in Art Education with Southeast Missouri State University. By the time I graduated, I had not only earned my certification to teach K-12 Art, I had also secured a job with my first district as a K-8 Art Teacher for Meadow Heights School District. I am entering my fifth year of teaching and still enjoy sharing my <em>love of art</em> with my students and teaching them everything I can.</p>
