<h2>Learning Color</h2>
<h3>Basics of Color</h3>
<p>Introduction-Here we will touch on the science of color and how the eye sees it, the color wheel, and the different types/levels of colors. Color is light reflecting or “bouncing” off an object as the object absorbs all the other colors in light.The color wheel is the artistic display of colors that is similar to a rainbow, except it goes all the way around. It shows three types of colors: Primary, Secondary, and Tertiary.</p>
<h3>Color Schemes</h3>
<p>Introduction-Color schemes are patterns or themes of colors for an artwork or creation. There are many different types of color schemes used both in art and in the modern world. Some basic color schemes include Complimentary, Triad, Monochromatic, and Analogous. Color schemes allow for an expression of a message or invoke emotion. Many modern concepts and industries in society use color schemes including advertising, entertainment, and even those in and affected by basic human communication.</p>
<h3>Color Theory and its Effect on the World</h3>
<p>Introduction-Color theory and color schemes are constantly in use in modern society and have been since the beginning of man. Not only is color theory an artistic pursuit but is also an important part of the human experience and can even be used as a tool to understand that experience. Color is used in basic communication from when human children are toddlers and can even be ingrained into a person’s environment and culture. People are unique in their development and each experience or understanding of color can vary from person to person.</p>
