<p>Here we will touch on the science of color and how the eye sees it, the color wheel, and the different types/levels of colors. Color is light reflecting or “bouncing” off an object as the object absorbs all the other colors in light.The color wheel is the artistic display of colors that is similar to a rainbow, except it goes all the way around. It shows three types of colors: Primary, Secondary, and Tertiary. When it comes to colors in art, you can mix your colors to create new ones. However, you need to understand the colors and how they interact to get your desired outcome. Let’s start with the three types of colors.</p>
<p><strong>Primary</strong>–Primary colors are “pure” colors that cannot be created from mixing colors. Red, Yellow, and Blue are the building blocks for other colors.</p>
<p><strong>Secondary</strong>–Secondary colors are made from the primary colors. These colors include Orange, Green, and Purple (or Violet).</p>

<br>
<p><strong>Tertiary</strong>–Tertiary colors are made from a primary and a secondary color that are beside each other in the color wheel or a combination of related colors. However, mixing too many different colors can lead to a brown or black color without careful measurement and consideration. Each tertiary color is between the primary and secondary color they share elements with and have two names they can be identified with. </p>

    href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2010/01/color-theory-for-designers-part-1-the-meaning-of-color/"><img src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/913c70da-028e-407e-a31e-aeff501aff09/colorstar-opt.jpg" alt="Color Wheel" class="center"></a>

<p>Color schemes are patterns or themes of colors for an artwork or creation. There are many different types of color schemes used both in art and in the modern world. Some basic color schemes include Complimentary and Analogous. Color schemes allow for an expression of a message or invoke emotion. Many modern concepts and industries in society use color schemes including advertising, entertainment, and even those in and affected by basic human communication.</p>
<p><strong>Complimentary</strong>–Complimentary color schemes contain two colors that are opposite from each other on the color wheel. These colors stand out strongly when put together and this can draw aesthetic attention. These types of schemes are common in decoration and also for sports team uniforms and logos. For example, Green and Red are a Complimentary Color Scheme that is commonly used in Christmas Decor.</p>
<p><strong>Analogous</strong>–Analogous color schemes contain three (or sometimes more) colors that are directly beside each other in the color wheel. This type of scheme creates a harmony that can be appealing to an audience. These types of schemes are common in advertising and other jobs focused in design. For example, Red-Orange, Orange, and Yellow-Orange are an Analogous Scheme that might be associated with fire and create or invoke a passionate or energized advertisement, or a volcanic landscape in a video game environment.</p>

<p>Color theory and color schemes are constantly in use in modern society and have been since the beginning of man. Not only is color theory an artistic pursuit but is also an important part of the human experience and can even be used as a tool to understand that experience. Color is used in basic communication from when human children are toddlers and can even be ingrained into a person’s environment and culture. People are unique in their development and each experience or understanding of color can vary from person to person.Communication examples that use color in our world include traffic signs and lights. We have been raised in the U.S. as drivers to know that Green means “Go”, Yellow means “Slow”, Red means “Stop”, and even Orange to tell us “Caution” that lets us know when there’s roadwork happening. However, there are also personal associations to these colors that are unique to each person. One woman may see red as a relaxing color that reminds her of her favorite fruits she likes to eat, while one man may see red as an exciting color because it's part of the uniform of his favorite baseball team. Everyone has a perspective on color that is both unique and shared in this society. How do <em>you</em> see these colors?</p>
<h3 id="section4">Questions for Student Thinking</h3>
<p>There are three types of colors we touched on. What's your favorite color? Can you say if it's Primary, Secondary, or Tertiary?</p>
<p>We only touched on two kinds of color schemes. What are some types you'd like to explore?</p>
<p>Think of your favorite hobby (art, sports, videogames, tv show, social media, etc.). Is there a colorful design involved with the hobby you enjoy? What kind of color scheme is involved with that design?</p>
<p>Look up a country or culture other than your own. Find a color that has a different meaning in that country or culture than your own's assigned meaning and another that is similar. Why do you think the meaning is different between two cultures? Why do you think the meaning is the same in two cultures?</p>
