        <h2>Colorful Culture- Breaking Down Color Theory and Study for Any Artist</h2>
        <main><p>Color . . . It is something that the average person can take for granted. Everyone remembers those primary school days of learning about the colors of the rainbow. However, some may be surprised that color can be a complex subject. Color can affect different aspects of a personâ€™s life. Their perspective, their culture, and even communication and preferences are all affected by color. Culture and society are also affected and color is used as a tool to convey messages sometimes without the use of words. This website is available to break down what color is, types of color schemes, and how color affects how individuals interact and interpret the world.</p></main>
